Every python version will save binary formats slightly different, so dbbuddy save states
must be made for each version supported. This needs to be done for ALL versions every

Simply launch databasebuddy under the Python version in question, and do a search for casp9.
Unit tests will need to be updated because the number of sequences will probably change.
