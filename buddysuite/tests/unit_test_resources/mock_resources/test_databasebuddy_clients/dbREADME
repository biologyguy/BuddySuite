Every python version will save binary formats slightly different, so dbbuddy save states
must be made for each version supported. This needs to be done for ALL versions every
time a new version is added.

Simply launch databasebuddy under the Python version in question, do a search for casp9,
then save the session in mock_resources/test_databasebuddy_clients.
Unit tests will need to be updated because the number of sequences will probably change.
